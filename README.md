# Spotify API Project (WIP)

Hi! This is a personal project I am working towards developing. My goal is to automate the process of adding songs to a Spotify playlist.
Currently, I am working on creating a playlist directly through the SPotify API and populating it with songs appearing in the Top 100 JPN
list (https://www.billboard.com/charts/japan-hot-100/), although the goal is to extend the project to any list of desired songs and hopefully
be able to develop an interactive App!

At the moment I am working on the process of authenticating users and creating the desired playlist. Next steps will include web scraping
for getting the desired content and populating the playlist.
